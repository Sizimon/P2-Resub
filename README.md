* A match histroy section to display past results
* Scoreboard and match result tracking

### Website Intentions
* The intentions of the website is simplicity and functionality, the website intends to offer a simple game, with a neutral color palette and leave a relaxing impression on the user. All while offering a fun simple game of chance.

#### For The User
* A clear direction of where to click to get the desired result, with a natural flow of information as the user plays the game, minimal buttons, just to keep it simple.

#### For The Developer
* The process was intended to be more mechanically enticing. I built this project as simple as possible, so it would help not only the user enjoy a simple game, but for me as a beginner developer to come to a better understanding with how HTML,CSS and Javascript come together to make things happen.




# PROCESS

* The design process was helped by WebDevSimplified, who put together a great video which created a simple RPS game, I took influence from him in order to get my ideas for the webpage.
* After getting some starting code and sitting to understand how it functions and comes together (also fixing bug issues with the tutorial code), it helped me really understand JS better, from then on I started adding my own features and customising and editting any other code I borrowed (mentioned in the script JS file).
* The fonts and colors I used were kept minimal, but complimented eachother well. The popups in the page were not invasive and easy to navigate around.
* The simple design created an atmosphere where I was left clicking and resetting for some time, just because of how pleasing the page was to look at for the eye.




# PAGE FEATURES

## Intro Popup 
* The intro screen when the page load is displayed and gives basic information about the game. 
* It also adds a name input with a submit button, which stores the name written by the player into the localstorage, which is later used to set the players name within the game according to the input.

## Game Screen 
* The Game screen after inputting name in the intro screen.
* Features a clean minimal design, with a; title, clear options to select and a scoreboard.

## Round Result 
* How the round played out is displayed just below the selections, and tells you whether you won/lost or if the game was a draw.

## Match History
* After clicking the selection of choice and the round ends, the result is displayed in the match history.

## Game End
* The Game ends when someone reaches the score of 3 (either the computer or player).
* When this happens the popup appears informing you whether you won or lost.
* In this popup there is also a button which instructs the user to reset the game.
* The reset button resets the match result, match history, scoreboard and takes away the end game popup.

# DESIGN CHANGES
There were design changes related to media queries and some technical issues:
* Had to remove the intro message and just leaves the rules in the intro popup on smaller devices, there was an issue with the amount of content there.
* There were some more design changes related to media query issues, however these were minimal and mainly included resizing fonts and moving some elements with margins.




# FUTURE FEATURES
These are the features I would like to include in the game:
* A match selection screen (where one can pick from best of 3, best to 3, and one in a chamber)
* A window on the corner of the screen which displays the past 3 match results (e.g 3-2)




# TESTING
## HTML:
![Screenshot](readme-images/htmlval.png)
There was one minor error popup about the form not needing a type attribute, that was quickly fixed and the HTML passed the validator.




## CSS:
![Screenshot](readme-images/cssval.png)
The CSS passed flawlessly.




## JS:
![Screenshot](readme-images/jsval.png)
JS also passed with no errors other than some missing semicolons which were fixed, the highlighted unused variables are called in HTML button onclick attributes.

## BUGS:
I had issues with trying to display the images in the the match history box, instead of the selection being displayed as the image, it was showing the filepath, I was trying to resolve it for hours, and the following code was the fix. 
``` const imgID = choice.image;
    const img = document.createElement('img');
    img.src = imgID;
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    div.appendChild(img); 
```
